# Lesson 19 Graph Applications Starter Repository

Hello, this is the starter repository for Lesson 19.

ONE member of your team should fork this repository. Then add the other members as Collaborators via the Settings tab.

Your website should hopefully deploy automatically every time you merge a Pull Request to the `main` branch. Check the Environments tab to the right to see the status of deployments. Check the Actions tab above for error messages.

All work should be done in this repository.

The final version of your code, analysis, images, and other pieces should eventually be combined in the `index.md` file, which will then deploy as an HTML page automatically.

You should NOT use the web interface to edit files directly on the main branch. Instead, you must:
- clone the repository
- create a feature branch
- make edits that you iteratively stage and commit
- push the branch to your shared repository
- create a Pull Request
- merge the PR into the main branch

Failure to follow this workflow will result in severe penalties, including the possible rejection of your submission.

All commits should be under your own username. Commiting work under someone else's name means they will get the credit, and you will get nothing (and therefore earn a failing grade!).
